# Versatile Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain of Thought (CoT)

This project demonstrates a chatbot system with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and a Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy. The chatbot is designed to work with WordPress blogs, providing contextually relevant responses based on retrieved content and enhanced by a logical reasoning process.

## Introduction
This project integrates a chatbot system into WordPress, using Hugging Face's `transformers` library for RAG and FAISS for vector-based retrieval. It demonstrates an end-to-end approach, including data retrieval from WordPress, generating embeddings, integrating Chain of Thought logic, and developing a Flask-based API for chatbot interaction.

## Features
- WordPress Data Retrieval and Embedding Generation.
- RAG-based Retrieval for chatbot responses.
- Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy for logical response generation.
- Flask-based REST API for chatbot interaction.
- Functional and performance testing with `flask_testing`.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, use the following commands:

```bash
# Ensure you have Python and pip installed
pip install requests transformers faiss-cpu flask flask_testing
Usage
After installation, you can run the Flask-based API to start the chatbot server:
python your_flask_app.py

Replace your_flask_app.py with the name of your Flask-based script. Once the server is running, you can send POST requests to the /chatbot/query endpoint with a JSON object containing query and context.

Example request:
{
    "query": "What's new in technology?",
    "context": "TechCrunch articles"
}

Example response:
{
    "response": "Given the context 'TechCrunch articles', here's the answer..."
}


Creating a README for GitHub involves explaining the project, its purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other relevant information. Here's an example README content for a project that builds a versatile chatbot with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhanced with a Chain of Thought (CoT) strategy and integrated into WordPress.

}
Configuration
Ensure the vector database is properly initialized and updated with embeddings from WordPress content. Customize the Chain of Thought logic to fit your specific use case.

Testing and Evaluation
Use unittest and flask_testing to test the functionality and performance of the chatbot system. Run the test script to ensure everything works as expected:
python your_test_script.py
